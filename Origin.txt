I just want to record this for the future - many, many thanks go to
16systems who went through the trouble to gather and host most of
this archive. I happend to stumble on their website and, being a
collector myself, downloaded all I could. I already offered some
versions of TC that I had on my harddrive, 16sys's collection
however showed me that I'm not the only one interested in this
kind of stuff. Hence I'm maintaining this mirror and have included
here some newer versions, language files and unofficial complementary
programs.
